Practice your ML skills on this approachable dataset!

### Problem Description<br>
The August 2022 edition of the Tabular Playground Series is an opportunity to help the fictional company Keep It Dry improve its main product Super Soaker. The product is used in factories to absorb spills and leaks.

The company has just completed a large testing study for different product prototypes. Can you use this data to build a model that predicts product failures?

### Dataset Description<br>
This data represents the results of a large product testing study. For each product_code you are given a number of product attributes (fixed for the code) as well as a number of measurement values for each individual product, representing various lab testing methods. Each product is used in a simulated real-world environment experiment, and and absorbs a certain amount of fluid (loading) to see whether or not it fails.

Your task is to use the data to predict individual product failures of new codes with their individual lab test results.

### Summary<br>
I achieved the auc score of 0.58296 on 26% test dataset
